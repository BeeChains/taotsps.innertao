## âš  Not Tested, RUN AT YOUR OWN RISk ðŸ›‘ This is an idea project... ðŸ’¡

Overview
The TAO Time-Series Prediction Subnet (TSPS) is a sophisticated tool designed for forecasting trends in the cryptocurrency market, with a primary focus on Bittensor ($TAO). It leverages advanced machine learning techniques, especially LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, to predict future market movements based on historical data.

Features
Accurate time-series prediction using LSTM networks.
Real-time data processing for up-to-date predictions.
Customizable model parameters for advanced users.
User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

Installation

Clone the Repository:
```git clone https://github.com/BeeChains/taotsps.innertao.git```
```cd taotsps.innertao```

Set Up Environment:
```python -m venv tsp-env``` 
```source tsp-env/bin/activate  # Windows: tsp-env\Scripts\activate```

Install Dependencies:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Usage
Run the Prediction Model:
```python tsp_model.py```

View Predictions:

Predictions will be displayed in the terminal or on the dashboard (if implemented).
Advanced Configuration:

Modify config.json or tsp_model.py for advanced model configurations.

In this config.json file:

"api_key": Replace ```"YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY"``` with the actual API key you obtain from Alpha Vantage.

"model_params": Here you can configure the parameters of the LSTM model, like hidden_layer_size, learning_rate, and the size of the training window (train_window).

"data_params": This section can be used to specify data-related parameters, such as the symbol for the cryptocurrency ("TAO" for "$TAO" in this case).

The config.json file allows you to easily change the configuration of your TSPS application without modifying the Python code.

Obtaining an API Key:

Visit the Alpha Vantage Website: Go to [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/).
Sign Up for an API Key: Usually, you will find a section for getting a free API key. Click on it and fill in the necessary details.
Retrieve Your API Key: After registration, Alpha Vantage will provide you with an API key. This key will be used to make requests to their service.

Using the API Key in Your Application:

Store the API Key Securely: Never hard-code your API key directly into your scripts (especially if you're sharing your code publicly). Instead, store it in a separate configuration file or use environment variables.
